# Using Firebase CLI to Manage Apps

Unfortunately, Firebase CLI doesn't have direct commands to create/delete apps through the command line. Apps must be managed through the Firebase Console web interface.

However, I can help you automate the process once you're signed in to Firebase Console.

## Option 1: Manual Steps (Recommended)

Since I need you to be signed in, here are the exact steps:

### Step 1: Sign in to Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/et3am-ca94c/settings/general
2. Sign in with your Google account

### Step 2: Delete Existing Apps
- Find each Android app → Click ⚙️ → Scroll down → "Delete app"
- Find each iOS app → Click ⚙️ → Scroll down → "Delete app"

### Step 3: Create New Apps
- Click "Add app" → Android → Package: `com.et3am.eqmsapp` → Download config
- Click "Add app" → iOS → Bundle ID: `com.et3am.eqmsapp` → Download config

## Option 2: After You Sign In

Once you're signed in to Firebase Console in your browser, let me know and I can:
1. Use browser automation to navigate and create the apps
2. Download the config files automatically
3. Update your project files

**Please sign in to Firebase Console, then let me know and I'll help automate the rest!**
