# 🚀 Quick Firebase Apps Setup

## What We Need

You need to be signed in to Firebase Console for me to help automate the app creation. Here's what we'll do:

1. **Delete existing Android/iOS apps** (if any)
2. **Create new Android app** with package: `com.et3am.eqmsapp`
3. **Create new iOS app** with bundle ID: `com.et3am.eqmsapp`
4. **Download config files** and update your project
5. **Run FlutterFire configure** to update `firebase_options.dart`

## Sign In First

1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/et3am-ca94c/settings/general
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. **Let me know when you're signed in**, and I'll help automate the rest!

## Or Follow Manual Steps

If you prefer to do it manually, see `DELETE_AND_RECREATE_FIREBASE_APPS.md` for detailed instructions.

**Once you're signed in to Firebase Console, I can help automate the entire process!**
