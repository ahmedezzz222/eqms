# Logo Setup Instructions

## Et'am Logo

The app uses the Et'am logo file: `et3am_app_logo.jpeg`

## Current Setup

- Logo file: `assets/images/et3am_app_logo.jpeg`
- The onboarding screen displays this logo with fade and scale animations
- If the logo file is missing, a fallback design will be shown with:
  - Arabic text "إطعام" (Et'am)
  - A Wi-Fi icon representing the "ع" character
  - The app name "Et'am" below

## File Location

```
assets/images/et3am_app_logo.jpeg
```

The app is already configured to load images from `assets/images/` directory (see `pubspec.yaml`).
