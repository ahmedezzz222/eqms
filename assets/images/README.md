# Login Image

Please place your login image file here with the name: `login_image.jpg`

The image should be a JPG file. If you have a different format (PNG, etc.), you can:
1. Rename it to `login_image.jpg` and update the code, OR
2. Keep the original extension and update the image path in `lib/main.dart` from `'assets/images/login_image.jpg'` to match your file name.

Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
